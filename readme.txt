first unzip all the zip files

here we use only one trial's data in multi source dataset as an example

the code for other sources are similar.

then run splitting table_table_default first to first create csv for train/val/test

we have another version for colab as splitting_table, we put it here as an archive

and then run splitting_folder to split the time series files in original folder and create train/val/test folders
